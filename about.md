This is a place where I can record the small learnings I come across day by day. Those tiny tidbits of knowledge that are often forgotten will be archived here. The topics will most likely be varied across computer science, design, sociology, physics, math, psychology, etc. Don't expect consistency ðŸ˜Ž

While this mini blog is for my records only, it's public facing because knowledge should be shared and learning is awesome. Got a small thing of interest you'd like to share with me? [Flick me a tweet](https://twitter.com/Sereeena).
