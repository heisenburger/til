So there's a meme going around ralking about how lobsters are "biologically immortal". And while this [isn't necessarily true](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/), it is true that lobsters don't [age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence) like anything else. As they get older they get stronger, more fertile, and their metabolism goes on without a hitch -- the opposite of what happens to us humans and pretty much any other animal species out there.

Someone mentioned this little tidbit at a bar, and of course, I had to know why.

As it turns out, for the reason behind this strange "immortality", we have to learn some molecular biology.
