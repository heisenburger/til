The origins of this form of 'cow' comes from the old 16th century Old Norse _kúga_, meaning _to oppress_. This is interesting given that _cow_ the noun, the one we're all familiar with (goes moo, yeah that one), has Germanic origins (which then flowed on to Old English, Dutch and German).

One word. Two completely different origins.
