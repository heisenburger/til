Two tidbits from last night:

1. Indo-Fijians (Indians who migrated to Fiji) make up 37.5% of the Fijian population. 61,000 people were brought from India between 1879 and 1916 to work in the sugarcane fields. Between the 1920s and 1930s, thousands more voluntarily migrated over to form the core of Fiji's business class.
2. Citrus oil can be used to clean off sticker residue from glass. Or better yet, rubbing alcohol.
