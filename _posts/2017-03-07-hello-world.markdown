I've noticed that I pick up small, random tidbits of interesting (and mundane) information every day, but they are never revisited or re-remembered again. This is an attempt to keep a record of everything wild and boring I happen to come across in life.

Some things to start off with:

- Always cut flower stems on a diagonal. This is so there is more surface area to soak up the water.
- Don't use heated tools on wet hair, it won't be as effective.
- Super oily skin needs to be moisturised else it will continue to be oily
